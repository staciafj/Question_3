# Question_3
Objective
The objective of this project is to apply JUnit and Java Code Coverage tools to thoroughly test and analyze a Java project hosted on GitHub. The primary goal is to achieve complete statement coverage for critical code modules. The final outcome will be a GitHub repository containing the test files and a coverage report, along with instructions on how to access and use them.

Project Overview
The project hosted on GitHub is a Java application, and our objective is to rigorously test it using JUnit and measure the code coverage using code coverage tools. The critical code modules, which may include if statements, switch-case statements, and for loops, will be the focus of our testing to ensure 100% statement coverage.

Steps to Achieve Complete Statement Coverage
To achieve complete statement coverage for the critical code modules, we will follow these steps:

Clone the Repository: Begin by cloning the project repository to your local development environment using Git.

shell
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/staciafj/Question_3.git
Set Up the Project: Make sure you have Java and a Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) installed. Import the project into your IDE.

Identify Critical Code Modules: Review the code and identify the critical code modules that include if statements, switch-case statements, and for loops.

Write JUnit Test Cases: Create JUnit test classes to cover these critical code modules. Ensure that each test case tests a specific scenario and that assertions are used to verify the expected outcomes.

Run JUnit Tests: Execute the JUnit test cases to ensure they pass and provide proper coverage.

Integrate Code Coverage Tools: Integrate code coverage tools like JaCoCo or Cobertura into your project. These tools will generate code coverage reports.

Generate Code Coverage Report: Run the code coverage tools to generate code coverage reports. Ensure that the reports capture the statement coverage for the identified critical code modules.

Review and Analyze Coverage: Review the code coverage reports to identify any areas of code that are not covered by the tests. Update your tests or code as necessary to improve coverage.

Commit Changes: Commit your changes to your local Git repository.

Push to GitHub: Push your changes to the project's GitHub repository.

Accessing Test Files and Coverage Report
You can access the test files and the coverage report in the GitHub repository under the "test" directory and the "coverage" directory, respectively.

Test Files: The JUnit test classes and test cases are located in the "test" directory. You can use these tests to verify the functionality of critical code modules.

Coverage Report: The code coverage report, generated using code coverage tools, can be found in the "coverage" directory. It provides insights into the statement coverage achieved by the tests.

Instructions for Use
To use the provided test files and coverage report:

Clone the project repository to your local machine using Git.

Open the project in your Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).

Run the JUnit test cases located in the "test" directory to verify the code's functionality.

Review the code coverage report located in the "coverage" directory to assess statement coverage. Identify any areas that need additional testing.

Modify the tests or code as necessary to improve coverage and ensure that critical code modules are thoroughly tested.

Conclusion
Thorough testing and code coverage analysis are essential steps in ensuring the reliability and quality of a Java project. By following the steps outlined in this README, you can effectively test and analyze the project hosted on GitHub and achieve complete statement coverage for critical code modules.
