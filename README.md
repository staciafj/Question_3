Question_3 
The primary objective of this project is to apply JUnit and Java Code Coverage tools to thoroughly test and analyze a Java project hosted on GitHub. The focus is on achieving complete statement coverage for critical code modules. This README contains details of the chosen test modules (test files) and provides a link to the GitHub repository where you can access the project, test files, and code coverage report.

Chosen Test Modules (Test Files)
In this project, we have identified critical code modules that require thorough testing to achieve complete statement coverage. Below are the chosen test modules (test files), along with a brief description of their purpose:

WindowTest.java: This test class focuses on testing the Window class, which is responsible for the game's user interface and logic. It covers aspects such as window initialization, grid initialization, thread creation, and various critical modules involving if, switch-case, and for statements.

DataOfSquareTest.java: This test class targets the DataOfSquare class, which manages the data and behavior of individual squares in the game grid. It ensures that color changes and other functionality are working correctly, covering if statements.

ThreadsControllerTest.java: The ThreadsController class controls the game's logic, including snake movement, collision detection, and food spawning. This test class comprehensively tests its critical modules, including if statements, switch-case statements, and for loops.

KeyboardListenerTest.java: The KeyboardListener class handles keyboard input for the game. This test class includes tests for key presses, such as right arrow, top arrow, left arrow, and bottom arrow, to ensure that the direction of the snake is correctly updated. It also tests unrecognized key presses to ensure that the direction remains unchanged.
